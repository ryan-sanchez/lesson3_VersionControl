## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The importance of Version Control Systems, and why its important to have backups of older versions of a file. In addition, it gives team members the access to easily edit and change fies.
2. How and why Git and services like Github are so important to getting a job in the tech industry. Entire projects can go awry if someone does not have access to previous versions of a file.
3. The interaction between a local and remote repository, and how one pushes files to the remote repository, and pulls files from there on to their own local repository.
