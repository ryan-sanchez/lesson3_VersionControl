                <span class="text-muted">Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is where all files for a project are pushed in order to have backups and previous, unchanged versions of the files. It makes retroactive edits much easier, as it can be very difficult to find one specific version of a file amidst hundreds of similarly named files. In addition, VCS help in group settings, where all members of a team can add to the system, showing what changes were made by who. Ultimately, VCS are responsible for security reasons, in case edits are made that alter the file, or if a file needs to be reverted back to an older version. This is very important to this class as files can change in an instant, and having access to older copies gives us the option to test changes without having to fully commit to them. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a fully public and free version control system. It has the ability to house huge files and can be accessed in a multitude of ways. There is no one dedicated software or website for Git, and rather, it is a language that can be used by a myriad of sources to house repositories and such. Once git is connected to a workspace/terminal, the owner of that workspace can push files to their respective git repository in order to save the back ups for the old versions of the files. Git is very important to this class as it is one of the main version control systems in use right now, a subject that will remain very prevalent this semester. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Github</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github is one of the largest Git services provided on the internet. It is a wonderful website where technology professionals and amateurs can push projects to showcase them and get feedback as well. Github was not determined with the social aspect in mind however, and still functions as a great Git repository, where files can be seamlessly linked from a workspace to the website. This term is very important to up and coming software professionals, as Github is used in many sectors of the tech industry, with many job openings requiring some knowledge of it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In terms of version control and git, the local repository is where files are stored on the local machine of an individual user. This is where personal changes are made to files and can be saved back onto the local repository. These can be linked to other services, such as Github and other VCS to see older versions of files. Local repositories can be created on the local machine, or duplicated from another local machineâ€™s repository. This term is important as it explaining to us what are own workspaces are and what we can do with them, as we shall be using our local repository all semester.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The remote repository is the repository that resides on a remote, or individual server, in which many team members have access to it. Whereas individual users use a local repository, the remote repository gives multiple people the option to push and pull files. This means that people can see who made what changes, and makes working as a team much more seamless. Each team member can then pull from the remote repository to his or her own local repository, and vice versa. This term is important, as we shall be using Github as our remote repository this semester, so we need to understand the full meaning of the word. </p>
